# Installation

Let's explore the SDK's installation steps. Make sure to have the React Native environment setup. See React Native's [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for more information.

Follow the steps below to get your app web3 ready.

## Requirements

- Android minSdkVersion = 26
- iOS platform >= 13
- XCode > 14

## Add shims for nodejs' libraries

React Native is based on [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore?language=objc) (part of WebKit) and does not use Node.js or the common Web and DOM APIs. As such, there are many operations missing that a normal web environment or Node.js instance would provide. [[1]](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/cookbook/react-native/#cookbook-reactnative-security).

For this reason we need to add shims for some of the operations not available in closed out environments like React Native:

In your `metro.config.js` (please, create one if you donâ€™t have it) add the following to shim the nodejs modules needed:

```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { mergeConfig } = require("@react-native/metro-config");

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/configuration
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
const extraNodeModules = require("node-libs-browser");

const config = {
	resolver: {
		extraNodeModules: extraNodeModules,
		unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
	},
};

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config);
```

You can now create a `shims.js` file and import it before other imports in
your app. It should have the following content:

```javascript
// Shim for TextEncoder and TextDecoder
import "fast-text-encoding";
```
